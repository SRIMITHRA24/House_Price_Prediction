- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning models
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model building using regression techniques
- Evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score
- Visualizations to understand trends and correlations

## How to Run
